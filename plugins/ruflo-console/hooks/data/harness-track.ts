/**
 * The incremental half of every file-backed adapter (ADR-486): each candidate is stat-ed (a link is refused, a vanished file is dropped), and
 * it is read again only when its size or mtime changed. A read that fails keeps the earlier summary and says so (stale), never a blank row.
 * One pass reads at most PASS_BYTES; what does not fit waits for the next pass, which is how 20 busy sessions stay inside a tick.
